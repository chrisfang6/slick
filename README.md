**MVVM** by [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html) + [dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) + [rxjava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) + [butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) + [retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda)

With *[Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html)*, the observable fields which are held by a ViewModel class are set into layout xml files, and then layouts would changed while ViewModel modifies these fields. 
UI sends Command to ViewModel for starting transactions, and ViewModel notice UI by Callbacks. 

Easy & clear :grin:
